Differences in the methods in phase3 compared to phase2:

Coverage-based CNV calls for each of the focal genes (Ace-1, Cyp6 regions, Gste regions, Cyp9k1 region) are made using the mode of CNV state for each gene, instead of using the definition of encompassed gene duplications. 

When matching CNVs across samples, in phase2 there was a sanity check that the same CNV allele was never called twice in the same sample. But it is actually possible for this to happen if the range of start and end positions for a given CNV allele becomes wide enough. That sanity check has therefore been removed, and instead a measure of how consistent the start and end points are is given by the 90% quantile range size of the start and end points. 

Read-based calling is more stringent, requiring 4 supporting diagnostic reads instead of 2.
